# Underwater-obstacle-avoidance

Hello everyone, welcome to this repository. This project is mainly on underwater vehicles obstacle avoidance with the use of two different neural networks. This work mainly refers to the following projects:https://github.com/xie9187/Monocular-Obstacle-Avoidance, https://github.com/XPFly1989/FCRN as well as https://github.com/iro-cp/FCRN-DepthPrediction.

### 1. Introduction
Nowadays, the AUVs (autonomous underwater vehichles) are widely used in underwater projects (underwater environment detection, cultural relic salvage, underwater rescues and etc). And in order to make them work smoothly, a great sense of obstacle avoidance is necessary. But because of the more complex underwater light conditions including light attenuation, dimmer environment, reflection, refraction along with the more complicated kinematics situation including caparicious current and bigger resistance, it is much harder for them to work well in the water. So we developed an ad-hoc methods to do that, which is the content of our project.
